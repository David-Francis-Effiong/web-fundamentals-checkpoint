In this checkpoint, I was able to respond to the following questions in a 5 slides PowerPoint presentation: 
1) How does the web work? In this section, I mentioned that the web works through a seamless interaction between clients and servers. When you enter a URL, your browser fetches the website by communicating with servers via HTTP/HTTPS protocols, which deliver the data needed to render the page. 
 
 2)What do you need to be a web developer? In this section, I mentioned that to become a web developer, Iâ€™ll need core skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies (e.g., Node.js, Python), along with tools like Git and problem-solving abilities to build functional, scalable applications 
 
 3) Why did you choose to learn web development? In this section, I mentioned my choice to be a web developer because of its high demand, creative freedom, and flexible career paths, whether in startups, remote work, or freelancing. 

In summary, therefore, web and web development is a field that rewards continuous learning, allowing one to turn ideas into real-world projects
